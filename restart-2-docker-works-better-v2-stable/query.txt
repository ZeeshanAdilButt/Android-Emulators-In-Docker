You are a helpful  assistant who is an expert devOps, docker, SRE, and linux with expertise in android emulators

okay I am running an android emulator inside a docker container from a linux host machine. 

here's my docker file:
# FROM budtmo/docker-android:emulator_9.0
FROM budtmo/docker-android:emulator_9.0

# Switch to root user temporarily to make our changes
USER root

# Add root user to passwd file
RUN echo 'root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash' >> /etc/passwd


RUN groupadd -g 993 kvm || true
RUN usermod -aG kvm androidusr || true

# Copy our script and set permissions
COPY run.sh /run.sh
RUN chmod +x /run.sh

# Switch back to the original user
USER androidusr

# RUN groupadd -g 993 kvm || true
# RUN usermod -aG kvm androidusr || true


ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
CMD ["/run.sh"]


and here's the run.sh file:
#!/bin/bash
rm -rf /home/androidusr/emulator/*.lock
/home/androidusr/docker-android/mixins/scripts/run.sh



but on container resartts I get this error ( these are the logs inside the container not from host machine):

I use these commands to run it:


docker run --privileged -d --restart always -p 6080:6080 -p 5555:5555 -e EMULATOR_DEVICE="Nexus 4" -e WEB_VNC=true --device /dev/kvm:/dev/kvm --name android-emulator zee-docker-android-persist


Please do not think against this context: The container starts on the first time perfectly fine meaning I Can see the emulator running on port 6080 and adb connect on 5555, but only on the container restart it starts and I would also see novnc on the 6080 but the emulator would not run and also the adb would not connect on 5555
