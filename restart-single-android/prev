What to Do Next
On your host, move your current emulator data (currently bound from C:\docker\android\android\avd or wherever) into a subfolder:
For example, create:
C:\docker\android\avd\nexus_5_9.0.avd
Move all the files (config.ini, system.img.qcow2, userdata, etc.) into that folder.
Edit your nexus_5_9.0.ini (in your host folder bound at /home/androidusr/.android/avd) so that its path= entry points to:
swift
Copy
/home/androidusr/.android/avd/nexus_5_9.0.avd
Remove the old binding for /home/androidusr/emulator from your docker run command (or update your Docker Compose file accordingly) so that the emulator uses the data from the standard location.
Restart your container.
